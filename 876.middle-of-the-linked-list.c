 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,5]'
 *
 * Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked
 * list.
 *
 * If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: [3,4,5]
 * Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 * Output: [4,5,6]
 * Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we
 * return the second one.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
 * 1 <= Node.val <= 100
 *
